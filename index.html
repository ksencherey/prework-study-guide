            JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that
            allows users to interact with websites.JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, 
            and the concepts you're already learning—such as conditional logic and arrays—can be applied to many other 
            in-demand OOP languages.
          </li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>
            Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects,
            interactivity, data communication, and much more.
          </li>
          <li>The script tag is added to the body element of the HTML file</li>
          <li>
            In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the
            page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are
            equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and
            false if the values are not equal.
          </li>
          <li>
            An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
            Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.
          </li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
          <li>
            A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task
            on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be
            executed over and over.
          </li>
          <li>
            A for loop contains the following three important statements: The
            first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we
            want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x
            and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is
            always 0), as shown in the following line of code: <code>var x = 0;</code> 
            <li>The
            second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the
            variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep
            running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item
            in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our
            shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following
            line of code: <code>x < shapes.length;</code></li>  
            <li> The final statement is what allows
            the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a
            predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time.
            The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the
            code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of
            code: <code>x++</code></li>
          <li><code>for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
              console.log(shapes[x]);
                }</code></li>
          </li>
        </ul>
